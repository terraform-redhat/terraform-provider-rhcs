}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Unique identifier of the cluster.

### Optional

- `kms_key_arn` (String) The key ARN is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a AWS Key Management Service (KMS) Key. It is a unique, fully qualified identifier for the AWS KMS Key. A key ARN includes the AWS account, Region, and the key ID(optional). After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
