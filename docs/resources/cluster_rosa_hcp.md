OpenShift managed cluster using ROSA HCP.



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `availability_zones` (List of String) Availability zones. This attribute specifically applies to the Worker Machine Pool and becomes irrelevant once the resource is created. Any modifications to the initial Machine Pool should be made through the Terraform imported Machine Pool resource. For more details, refer to [Worker Machine Pool in ROSA Cluster](../guides/worker-machine-pool.md)
- `aws_account_id` (String) Identifier of the AWS account. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `aws_billing_account_id` (String) Identifier of the AWS account for billing. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `aws_subnet_ids` (List of String) AWS subnet IDs. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `cloud_region` (String) AWS region identifier, for example 'us-east-1'.
- `name` (String) Name of the cluster. Cannot exceed 15 characters in length. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `sts` (Attributes) STS configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sts))

### Optional

- `channel_group` (String) Name of the channel group where you select the OpenShift cluster version, for example 'stable'. For ROSA, only 'stable' is supported. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `compute_machine_type` (String) Identifies the machine type used by the initial worker nodes, for example `m5.xlarge`. Use the `rhcs_machine_types` data source to find the possible values. This attribute specifically applies to the Worker Machine Pool and becomes irrelevant once the resource is created. Any modifications to the initial Machine Pool should be made through the Terraform imported Machine Pool resource. For more details, refer to [Worker Machine Pool in ROSA Cluster](../guides/worker-machine-pool.md)
- `destroy_timeout` (Number) This value sets the maximum duration in minutes to allow for destroying resources. Default value is 60 minutes.
- `disable_waiting_in_destroy` (Boolean) Disable addressing cluster state in the destroy resource. Default value is false, and so a `destroy` will wait for the cluster to be deleted.
- `etcd_encryption` (Boolean) Encrypt etcd data. Note that all AWS storage is already encrypted. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `etcd_kms_key_arn` (String) Used for etcd encryption. The key ARN is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a AWS Key Management Service (KMS) Key. It is a unique, fully qualified identifier for the AWS KMS Key. A key ARN includes the AWS account, Region, and the key ID(optional). After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `host_prefix` (Number) Length of the prefix of the subnet assigned to each node. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `kms_key_arn` (String) Used to encrypt root volume of compute node pools. The key ARN is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a AWS Key Management Service (KMS) Key. It is a unique, fully qualified identifier for the AWS KMS Key. A key ARN includes the AWS account, Region, and the key ID(optional). After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `machine_cidr` (String) Block of IP addresses for nodes. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `pod_cidr` (String) Block of IP addresses for pods. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `private` (Boolean) Provides private connectivity from your cluster's VPC to Red Hat SRE, without exposing traffic to the public internet. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `properties` (Map of String) User defined properties. It is essential to include property 'role_creator_arn' with the value of the user creating the cluster. Example: properties = {rosa_creator_arn = data.aws_caller_identity.current.arn}
- `proxy` (Attributes) proxy (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--proxy))
- `replicas` (Number) Number of worker/compute nodes to provision. Requires that the number supplied be a multiple of the number of private subnets. This attribute specifically applies to the Worker Machine Pool and becomes irrelevant once the resource is created. Any modifications to the initial Machine Pool should be made through the Terraform imported Machine Pool resource. For more details, refer to [Worker Machine Pool in ROSA Cluster](../guides/worker-machine-pool.md)
- `service_cidr` (String) Block of IP addresses for the cluster service network. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `tags` (Map of String) Apply user defined tags to all cluster resources created in AWS. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `upgrade_acknowledgements_for` (String) Indicates acknowledgement of agreements required to upgrade the cluster version between minor versions (e.g. a value of "4.12" indicates acknowledgement of any agreements required to upgrade to OpenShift 4.12.z from 4.11 or before).
- `version` (String) Desired version of OpenShift for the cluster, for example '4.11.0'. If version is greater than the currently running version, an upgrade will be scheduled.
- `wait_for_create_complete` (Boolean) Wait until the cluster is either in a ready state or in an error state. The waiter has a timeout of 20 minutes, with the default value set to false
- `wait_for_std_compute_nodes_complete` (Boolean) Wait until the cluster standard compute pools are created. The waiter has a timeout of 60 minutes, with the default value set to false. This can only be provided when also waiting for create completion.

### Read-Only

- `api_url` (String) URL of the API server.
- `console_url` (String) URL of the console.
- `current_version` (String) The currently running version of OpenShift on the cluster, for example '4.11.0'.
- `domain` (String) DNS domain of cluster.
- `external_id` (String) Unique external identifier of the cluster. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `id` (String) Unique identifier of the cluster.
- `ocm_properties` (Map of String) Merged properties defined by OCM and the user defined 'properties'.
- `state` (String) State of the cluster.
