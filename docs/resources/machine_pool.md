# rhcs_machine_pool (Resource)

Machine pool.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "rhcs_machine_pool" "machine_pool" {
  cluster             = "cluster-id-123"
  name                = "mpname"
  machine_type        = "r5.xlarge"
  replicas            = 3
  labels = {one="bar1bari", two ="baz2il"}
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `cluster` (String) Identifier of the cluster. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `machine_type` (String) Identifier of the machine type used by the nodes, for example `m5.xlarge`. Use the `rhcs_machine_types` data source to find the possible values. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `name` (String) Name of the machine pool. Must consist of lower-case alphanumeric characters or '-', start and end with an alphanumeric character. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.

### Optional

- `autoscaling_enabled` (Boolean) Enables autoscaling. If `true`, this variable requires you to set a maximum and minimum replicas range using the `max_replicas` and `min_replicas` variables.
- `availability_zone` (String) Select the availability zone in which to create a single AZ machine pool for a multi-AZ cluster. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `aws_additional_security_group_ids` (List of String) AWS additional security group ids. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `aws_tags` (Map of String) Apply user defined tags to all machine pool resources created in AWS. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `disk_size` (Number) Root disk size, in GiB. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `ignore_deletion_error` (Boolean) Indicates to the provider to disregard API errors when deleting the machine pool. This will remove the resource from the management file, but not necessirely delete the underlying pool in case it errors. Setting this to true can bypass issues when destroying the cluster resource alongside the pool resource in the same management file. This is not recommended to be set in other use cases
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels for the machine pool. Format should be a comma-separated list of 'key = value'. This list will overwrite any modifications made to node labels on an ongoing basis.
- `max_replicas` (Number) The maximum number of replicas for autoscaling functionality.See OpenShift [documentation](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/main/cloud_experts_tutorials/cloud-experts-getting-started/cloud-experts-getting-started-what-is-rosa.adoc) for maximum allowed values.
- `max_spot_price` (Number) Max Spot price. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `min_replicas` (Number) The minimum number of replicas for autoscaling functionality. Single zone clusters need at least 2 nodes, multizone clusters need at least 3 nodes.
- `multi_availability_zone` (Boolean) Create a multi-AZ machine pool for a multi-AZ cluster (default is `true`). After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `replicas` (Number) The number of machines in the pool. Single zone clusters need at least 2 nodes, multizone clusters need at least 3 nodes. See OpenShift [documentation](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/main/cloud_experts_tutorials/cloud-experts-getting-started/cloud-experts-getting-started-what-is-rosa.adoc) for maximum allowed values.
- `subnet_id` (String) Select the subnet in which to create a single AZ machine pool for BYO-VPC cluster. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.
- `taints` (Attributes List) Taints for a machine pool. Format should be a comma-separated list of 'key=value'. This list will overwrite any modifications made to node taints on an ongoing basis. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--taints))
- `use_spot_instances` (Boolean) Use Amazon EC2 Spot Instances. After the creation of the resource, it is not possible to update the attribute value.

### Read-Only

- `availability_zones` (List of String) A list of Availability Zones. Relevant only for multiple availability zones machine pool. For single availability zone check "availability_zone" attribute.
- `id` (String) Unique identifier of the machine pool.
- `subnet_ids` (List of String) A list of IDs of subnets in which the machines of this machine pool are created. Relevant only for a machine pool with multiple subnets. For machine pool with single subnet check "subnet_id" attribute

<a id="nestedatt--taints"></a>
### Nested Schema for `taints`

Required:

- `key` (String) Taints key
- `schedule_type` (String) Taints schedule type
- `value` (String) Taints value
